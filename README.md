# Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI
JetBrains Academy Project

This project is a tic-tac-toe game with a 3*3 size field. The game provides the opportunity to play against another person or with one of 3 levels of AI (easy, medium and difficult - undefeated champion). It's funny that you can choose the AI versus AI game mode and watch them play against each other. Take a look at the instructions below to understand how to use the program.

> Menu loop can interpret two commands: start and exit.

> The command start should take two parameters: who will play X and who will play O. For example: 
* star user user
* start user easy
* start medium user
* start user hard
* start hard easy
 
> The exit command should simply end the program.
